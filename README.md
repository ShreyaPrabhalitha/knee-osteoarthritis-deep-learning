# Knee Osteoarthritis Diagnosis using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This repository contains code for automated diagnosis and prediction of knee osteoarthritis using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on knee MRI and X-ray images.

Deep learning-based system to detect and classify osteoarthritis severity and predict progression for early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features
- Automated detection and classification of knee osteoarthritis severity (Kellgren-Lawrence grades 0-4)
- Support for DICOM, JPEG, and PNG medical imaging formats
- Uses ResNet50 CNN architecture with transfer learning
- Data preprocessing pipeline for medical images including resizing and normalization
- Training, evaluation, and model saving workflows
- Evaluation based on classification reports and confusion matrices
